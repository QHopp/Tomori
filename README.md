# Tomori

*A Discord Bot with some pretty nice ideas*

## Description

A Discord Bot made for friends and for my own Discord Server. It's written in C# using .NET Core with
the [DSharpPlus](https://github.com/DSharpPlus/DSharpPlus) library.

## Ideas

| State | Functionnality                                                                              | Priority (1-3) |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |

| ❌     | Add personnal statistics such as levels (gained when talking), time connected (if possible) | 2              |
| ✔️    | Add logging                                                                                 | ~           |
| ✔️    | Add help                                                                                    | ~              |
| ❌     | Delete messages                                                                             | 1              |
| ❌     | Move messages from one channel to another
|      ✔️          | Receive news from RSS feeds | ~

The level of priority is designed as follows :

1. It will be done
2. Somewhat important but not in the first place
3. Not guaranteed at all
